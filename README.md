# ðŸŒŽ gogo 

WebKit-based Gopher browser. Inspired by
https://github.com/Lartu/OpenNapkin.

Uses https://gopher.commons.host/ and your operating system's WebView
to browse Gopher via https://github.com/Boscop/web-view.

## installation

Standalone binaries are coming soon. For now you have to build from
source. 

On Linux, you must first install webkit2gtk:

    sudo apt install webkit2gtk-4.0

Then, assuming you have Rust/Cargo and Git installed:

    git clone https://github.com/dvkt/gogo
    cd gogo
    cargo install --path .
    gogo <gopher-url>
